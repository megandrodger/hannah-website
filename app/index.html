 <p>Over the last eight months I have been working across several teams
  delivering services for Home Office Digital. During that time I have
  been honing the necessary skills to design and realise a successful
  user centered project, and gained huge experience and confidence working
  embedded in agile delivery teams. </p>

    <h3>Mapping the problem area</h3>
    <p>On both teams I have been working with and other teams I have been brought in to provide a pair of fresh eyes and map out the systems they are working on.
In the project to the right, a discovery around the industry of animal science, I was asked to
help make clear the existing process and people that a complex document had to go through during an application for animal testing. Separating out the stages, and drawing out everything that could happen at each point allowed the team to start to understand what this document could be in order to accomodate every users needs.
In situations where I have been called in to provide fresh eyes for a team that need clarification I have been brought in to map out systems that they are working on.
I was brought in to help map the project area in a discovery about the industry of animal science, which involved understanding how a complex document is used and understood by people in order to consider what could accomodate every users needs, as well as how the whole end to end process could be understood by future team members.
Embedded in a team designing an internal communication tool that is to book the most likely to travel, after sitting in on workshops discussing how the most effective passage of information should go I create a map of this information. This then allowed the team start to work out what was completely necessary at each point and who needed to recieve it

    <h3>Visual Communication</h3>
    <p> I have been called upon to use communication skills within my teams and in the wider design department. Communication is key to be able to share ideas and have confidence that everyone is understanding what you are describing/talking about.
One example of this that I worked on department wide was a set of posters that would collect the knowledge around what constitutes a good discovery, good alpha etc. We wanted to have something that could act as a support for teams to hold up reminders of best practice when it is hard to stop pressure above wanting a single outcome delveloped in an alpha stage, or a pre-determined technology in a discovery.
