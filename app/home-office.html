            Working on a home office digital delivery team
          </h1>
          <p>Home office digital</p>

          <p>Over the past eight months I have been based on various home office digital teams, all delivering digital services. During this time, I have developed a good understanding of how agile practices can support effective user-centered design, how the interplay of various roles can work, the collaboration between the developers, the BA and the design team, and overall how design and research thinking can provide the steer to create services that have users needs at the core.</p>

          <p>Over this time I have contributed to many projects and honed skills in interaction design that have directly impacted projects. I have drawn out the specific elements, skills and processes that I have been practicing that I believe are vital to the role of a designer at the Home Office.</p>

    <h3>Mapping</h3>

<p>I am skilled at being able to see the full picture of complex systems and while working with user researchers and by mapping out particular services have allowed a wider understanding of what is happening, or an existing process that has enabled decision-making and service design that has saved time and money.</p>
<p>Examples:</br>
  Animal Science</br>
  Right to rent smart answers</br>
  Returns and movements information transfer</p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>

    <p>I have been able to bring my background in communication design to produce posters both within teams and across the wider Home Office Digital, that have been used to share and encourage core values and best practice.
      <p>Examples:</br>
        Agile stages: Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live</br>
        Service Operations Jira Process</br>

    <h3>Collaborative service design</h3>

    <p>I have been a key member of workshops to interrogate the core user needs, or either taking a wider view to gather higher level key problems. In particular - this returns and movements, and internal service essentially the problem had come into being to replace contracts that were being replaced and renewed, when coming to a 'health check' we needed to fully understand the actual problem that needed answering and all the various user needs. From an intense workshop taking a wider view we were able to break it down to the core problem.</p>
    <p>When working within the wider home office, and take on board agile and design training to champion the user as the basis of important decisions, standing up for them in the face of pressure from above.</p>
      <p>Examples:</br>
        Returns and movements</br>
        Mapping participants</br>

    <h3>Rapid prototyping</h3>

    <p>Working in fast paced teams where iterations are regularly tested, I have been relied upon to use insights from user research into prototypes that has allowed us to test and prove hypothesis and observe user behaviour.</p>
      <p>Examples:</br>
        Right to rent guidance</br>
        Returns and movements time select</br>
