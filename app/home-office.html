            Working on a home office digital delivery team
          </h1>
          <p>Home office digital</p>

          <p>Over the past nine months I have been working as an Interaction Design intern based on various home office digital teams, all delivering digital services. During this time, I have developed a good understanding of how agile practices can support effective user-centered design, failing fast, the interplay of various roles, and how certain ceremonies can support communication, awareness and motivation. The time has been a huge learning curve, from continuous collaboration with researchers, business analysts and developers to realise your designs, to how differently users can understand a service and use a design prototype that may have seemed self-explanatory. Over this time my contributions to these teams have been impactful in many ways;  I have drawn out below and how they fit into the core skills of an interaction designer at the Home Office.</p>

    <h3>Mapping problem areas</h3>

<p>The systems and networks of users that belong to any government service is inevitably complex and messy. Mapping out the problem area, whether it’s how information needs to pass through a chain of people, or what decisions a set of users need to go through to take part in a service, is essential to be able to create a service that fits all parts of it. I have been asked to work with user researchers to visually map out various projects, which has allowed either stakeholders, or other team members to gain an understanding of the process, ie in animal science to the right, and in some cases, the Right to rent smart answers, we were able to make the decision to create an alternative simple guidance that have saved time and money.</p>
<p>Examples:</br>

  Right to rent smart answers</br>

    <h3>Visual Communication</h3>

    <p>Good visual communication is key to ensure that ideas are understood clearly by people when asking them to commit to a way of thinking, or to have an idea of what we are proposing. I have been able to bring my background in communication design to produce posters both within teams and across the wider Home Office Digital, that have been used to share and encourage core values and best practice.</p>
      <p>Examples:</br>
        Agile stages: Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live</br>
        Service Operations Jira Process</br></p>

    <h3>Collaborative service design</h3>

    <p>Working collaboratively with not just your design team but your developers, product owner and wider team has been proven to be the best way to keep user needs as the core driving force. Within the teams I have worked on I have been a key member of cross-discipline workshops where we have used collective expertise to understand research and discover and design solutions to the essential service’s problems. In particular on Returns and Movements as an internal service distilling the real crux of the problem, all of the users needs, and how we were answering it with the service we were creating, was difficult and required taking a step back and collecting input to come to a clear understanding. This was also a lesson on when championing agile processes and the user in response to pressure from stakeholders or higher positions is an important part of team service design.

    <h3>Rapid prototyping</h3>

    <p>Users interacting with a prototype or design is one of the fastest way to understand what is and isn’t working. In the Home Office digital design iterations are tested regularly and feedback has been fed back to the whole team, so not only whether the interaction is working is seen by the design team, but the developers and delivery manager understand why elements are important. I have been relied upon to use insights from user research into prototypes that has allowed us to test and prove hypothesis and observe user behaviour in various different services.</p>
