            Accessibility posters
          </h1>
          <p>Home office digital</p>

          <p>Following a building of knowledge collecting on how you can make your designs more accessible for a set of different access needs, a home office designer Karwai wanted to consolidate this knowledge and make it shareable so created a set of Accessibility posters.
These have been shared wider than even just government, and are being used as a resource for designers and educators.</p>

          <p>The next step was to make the set of posters accessible themselves. I began by researching and creating accessible pdfs converting the posters using a combination of indesign and acrobat pro, and after a couple of rounds of feedback from the Home Office accessibility community we uploaded them to github. Pdfs still have their limitations; they need to be downloaded, they are restricted to the format contrast and colour that the pdf was in, and are not fully able to be structured for screen readers.</p>
          <p>I started to prototype an html version of the posters with Simon, another designer trialling different frameworks, using the process to upskill my coding ability in html, css and sass. Again from continued feedback from our Accessibility lead, and after presenting the posters at two different cross government events, we have arrived at a responsive version of the posters in a similar format that they exist in originally.</p>

        <p>Wanting to further utilise the affordances that a website provide, we prototyped with sketches and quick trials how the information on the poster might best be used, navigated and added to in the future, thinking about whether a function that could apply filters to all of the ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ would be more useful, or them true to their original form. Though we are still iterating small design features we have settled on the more simple form but allowing for additional information to be added, allowing easy upkeep as we move forward, and for collaboration as more knowledge is created. </p>
