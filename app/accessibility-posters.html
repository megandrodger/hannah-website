          <p>Brief to create fully accessible versions of the Accessibility Posters, designed by Karwai Pun</p>

          <p>Initially to quickly create a static but accessible version of the posters that could be used by screenreaders, I researched how to create an accessible pdf and converted the posters using indesign and adobe. After a couple of rounds of feedback from the accessibility community, we had a working set, though they still required downloading, and were limited to the format - contrast, colours etc that the pdf was in.

Starting to convert the posters into html, working with the other design intern Simon, we trialled different frameworks, a heavier bootstrap, and more successful streamlined skeleton. Again from continued feedback from our Accessibility lead, and from people we presented to we have arrived at a responsive version of the posters in a similar format that they exist in originally. </p>
          <p>Wanting to utilise the affordances that a website provide, we began to sketch how the posters might be best used, navigated, referred to and added to, as additional knowledge and accessibility ... are collected. Sketching out versions that could be all bits of do’s and don’t advice that could be filtered, and versions that expand depending on how much information you would want. Keeping it in it’s simplist form to allow contributions and easy upkeep going forward we have settled on keeping the posters as their own entities, but allowing for extra information.</p>
