<p>Markfield is a community centre that has been created in an old water mill in North London. It supports autistic children and adults with activities, classes and a huge outdoor adventure area that has been thoughtfully created with the needs of an autistic child. There are huge limitations to the building itself, having been appropriated not purpose built; I was part of a two week architecture and design workshop called ‘Designing Empathy’ that was brought in to research and create suggestions for small transformations that could make the space better suited to its users.</p>

<p>The course was run by Muf Architecture, an architecture and design practice that focuses on social infrastructure and accessibility in their work. The idea was that we take some experimental design and research exercises, all within the space and with the staff and community of Markfield to try and develop higher levels of empathy whilst designing. This involved yoga and meditation every morning, art workshops with the staff, rapid observation exercises with a writer, rudimentary graphic design tasks, and acting and improv workshops.</p>

<p>The culmination of all of these activities interspersed with prototyping, both model size and with any props we could find, was presented back to the the users throughout, finishing in a final show and tell with visualisations. The success of truly understanding the different users of the building was clear as we began to feed back to them, and they chose a couple of the designs, mine being one of them, to implement over the next few months. I am involved in this ongoingly as it moves into the next phase.</p>
