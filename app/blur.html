      The blur between performances of the self
    </h1>
    <p>Masters project</p>

<p>A research project into the behavioural changes and constructs that happen when we become aware of being watched.</p>
<p>Through observing our behavioural habits with social media had become interested in how people performed certain aspects of their lives in front of a camera. Conducting research in the various ways that people do this, from catching the moment that people are aware that they are in a public space, to going as an extra on reality tv shows where cast members play versions of themselves on and off of the camera, I began to want to find a way to see if I could capture this behaviour in real life.

<p>After looking at the promenade as a old way that people presented themselves in the public arena, I began a series of iterative experiments trying to record and compare the way people’s behaviour changes when they are aware of being filmed. This involved surreptitiously filming someone as they walked through a park, approaching them to ask if they would allow to re-record them to allow me to compare their gait and body language, and then re-walk the same stretch.</p>

<p>Collecting dual sets of footage each time, I became interested in them when I started overlaying the two and observing the blur between the two pieces of footage; an illustration of the change. Devising more accurate, and more pronounced ways of capturing this through each attempt,</p>

<p>Creating one last experiment to see how far I could manipulate the blur between the two moving footages, taking advantage of they consciousness of repeated actions and time in front of the camera, I conducted a workshop, with an elaborate construction to capture their movement before they arrived, Asking them to try capture aspects of their exaggerated performed personality in the workshop I had a series of characters overlayed with the unconscious version of that person. </p>
