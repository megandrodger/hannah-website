            Mapping participants

          <p>Home office digital</p>

          <p>The brief was to create an internal tool that would support collecting digital inclusion information about research participants at Home Office Digital. Encourage a more unified undertanding of the Digital Inclusion categories</p>

          <p>About: When I joined the project, a lot of work had been put into creating a prototype of a series of questions that researchers would be able to answer to capture which digital inclusion category their participant was in. We initially worked on expanding the prototype to make it more usable with clear instructions and to allow the information entered to be viewed in a dashboard format, testing with users and iterating these designs.</p>

          <p>Whilst we used these learnings and the resulting prototype as a proof of concept, after attending a workshop on ‘The problem to solve’ by Kate Tarling, We held a team workshop to establish whether we had clear in our head what we were answering. Combined another user researcher’s realisation that a discovery phase hadn’t been done we used the outcomes of these conversations to kick off a period of research and mapping the problem area.

Working with the team, we extracted key users, user needs, and an underestanding of what exactly and why this tool was needed, preparing us to be able to go into an alpha with a clear knowledge of what we wanted the tool to fulfill. As an internal tool there were users of the data, and users that would interact with the collection of the data and clearly understanding the two was key. </p>

          <p>I held a workshop with the user research community to draw out their processes and understandings, and give us clear needs to move forward with the protoyping.</p>
          <p>We are now in a low fidelity prototyping stage, where we are rapidly testing our hypothesis and testing the prototypes with users. </p>
